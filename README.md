## üë®‚ÄçüíªAuthor's note
I've developed and deployed this project a while ago, but never shared it to allow contribution and transparency. Now it's time to fix it. 
This README is generated via LLM, so it's not ideal, but I like how it picked up on the essence and deacribed modules. Shoutout to @eli64s for his https://github.com/eli64s/README-AI üôå

## üí¨ Usecase: 
Add bot to the group and passively wait until some message will fit into a poetic figure. JPoetry will pick up on this and will generate an image with related message.

## üìç Overview

The jpoetry project is a Telegram bot that converts messages into poetic format using natural language processing techniques. It offers core functionalities such as generating different types of poems from given messages, providing cheat sheets with information on poem types and genres, and creating beautiful images representing the poems. The bot enhances the messaging experience by adding a touch of creativity and cultural enrichment through the art of poetry.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture with separate modules for different functionalities. It uses the aiogram library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API. The project also includes Docker images for development and deployment stages.      |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The project relies on external libraries such as Poetry and aiogram. These libraries provide additional functionalities and simplify development.                                                                                                           |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase is well-organized into smaller, modular components, such as `config.py`, `poetry.py`, `answers.py`, and `bot.py`. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the system's functionality, providing maintainability and ease of understanding. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase currently does not provide explicit information on testing strategies or tools being used. Implementation of automated tests using frameworks such as pytest would be beneficial for ensuring the stability and correctness of the project.    |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | The codebase does not explicitly mention performance optimization techniques. However, the use of frameworks like aiogram and efficient algorithm design in modules like `poetry.py` indicates considerations for performance.                              |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase exhibits few security measures, such as leveraging environment variables for access tokens. Further security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, are essential to prevent malicious attacks and secure sensitive user data.   |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase currently uses Git for version control. It is advisable to follow best practices, such as providing clear commit messages and maintaining a structured branching strategy, to facilitate collaboration and codebase management.                |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The project integrates with the Telegram Bot API through the aiogram library. The use of image manipulation libraries and TrueType font files indicates potential integration with external image generation services or libraries for creating poetry images. |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The codebase does not specifically address scalability. However, the modular architecture provides a foundation for introducing scalability measures such as load balancing, distributed processing, and caching for handling increased usage and growth.   |

## ü§ù Contributing


---

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
